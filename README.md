This project is a classic Snake Game built to understand core game development concepts using modern frontend tools.
It focuses on grid-based movement, game loops, and real-time state updates in a React environment.

The game is implemented using a 2D grid system, where the snake moves cell-by-cell, grows after eating food, and ends when it collides with walls or itself.
State management is used to control the snake’s position, direction, score, and game status.

This project helped me learn:

Game logic and movement algorithms

2D grid representation using arrays

Real-time updates with timers

Collision detection and scoring logic

Clean and modular React component design

Built as a learning project to strengthen problem-solving, logic building, and React fundamentals.
